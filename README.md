# deep-learning-tutorial
This is a deep learning tutorial containing handwritten Softmax, handwritten Back Propogation, FNN, CNN, RNN, Adversarial Attack, XAI, VAE, GAN, etc. These code is all written based on Python 3.0 +.

It is quite convenient for you to do exercise yourself, because all the data sets have been included. You can run all the code locally except for **(6) adversarial attack**, which is recommended to be run on Google Colab.
