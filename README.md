# deep-learning-tutorial
This is a deep learning tutorial containing handwritten Softmax, handwritten Back Propogation, FNN, CNN, RNN, Adversarial Attack, XAI, VAE, GAN, etc.

It is quite convenient for you to do exercise yourself, because all the data sets have been included. You can run all the code locally except for **(6) adversarial attack**, which is recommended to be run on Google Colab.
